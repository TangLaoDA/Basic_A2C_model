# Basic_A2C_model
Tensorflow implementation of basic A2C model.    
This is an implementation of basic A2C algorithm to play the game:"CartPole-v0".
The A2C(Advantage Actor Critic) is the improved version of Actor_Critic,if you have experience in training Actor_Critic model,you must find that it is hard to converge and remain stable.   
The gradient of the Actor_Critic is as follows:

The gradient of the A2C is as follows:

The parameter update process of the A2C is as follows:

You can Change code to play other OpenAi Gym games.  
You can also Optimize this algorithm.
